# CIFAR10-with-CNN-84-Percentage-Accuracy-

Convolution Neural Network(CNN) was used this time for the CIFAR10 Dataset.Addition to that Batch Norm and drop out were introducted too avoid overfitting. The network of the model i used is below

As this network is just plain, Hyper parameters tuning wasnt done and epochs used was 50. Accuracy we got was 84% which is lot  higher than the model we used without CNN. Accuracy of this model still can be increased by hyper parameters tuning and deeper proprocessing. GPU used was NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX 1050 TI
